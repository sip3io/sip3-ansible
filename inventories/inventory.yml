# Before run the playbook, please check inventory file
# You should setup properties for correct installation
#
# To run playbook, please use:
# ansible-playbook -i inventories/inventory.yml playbooks/sip3.yml
#
# Also you can set tags which will be use: sip3, storage, frontend, backend
# E.g.
# ansible-playbook -i inventories/inventory.yml playbooks/sip3.yml -t storage
#
# tag sip3: will manipulate with sip3 components, such as SIP3 Captain, Salto, Twig, Hoof
# tag storage: will manipulate only with components MongoDB and InfluxDB
# tag frontend: will manipulate only with components SIP3 Hoof and Grafana
# tag backend: will manipulate with components, such as SIP3 Salto, Twig
#
# Also you set exclusion host.
# For example, you need run playbook without captain
# ansible-playbook -i inventories/inventory.yml playbooks/sip3.yml --limit 'all:!captain'
